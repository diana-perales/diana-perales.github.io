subtitle: Wepa, let's check out parasites!

I made this website to share the projects I will be working on/am working on as a UW graduate student and provide a relatable view of: what parasites are, how does someone who studies can be, where we can find parasites, and how are they? And if you are interested in seeing photos/videos or worms, you might have found the right website for you! If you also stumble into charismatics worms, feel free to contact me.
