If you explore fecal matter in a microscope (with the guidance of a veterinarian!) you might also stumble into the world of parasites, in this case nematodes!

## My story

My earliest photos capture the international friendships my parents made in Sendai, Japan, where my father was completing his PhD. When I was around three years old, we moved to Peru. Although we stayed there for less than a year, it was a meaningful time in which I connected with my Peruvian roots, learning about the culture, food, family, and the vibrant, bustling life of Lima. 

Later, after my father accepted a professorship at the University of Puerto Rico, our family moved once again, this time to the beautiful island of Puerto Rico, where I lived until I completed my masterâ€™s degree at UPRM. While I proudly recognize my Peruvian heritage, I also strongly identify with Puerto Rican culture. Life here is full of beauty and unpredictability; our summers are marked by both sunshine and natural disasters, making each year an unforgettable experience.
