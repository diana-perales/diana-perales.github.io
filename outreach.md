<div style="text-align: center;"> Throughout my undergraduate years, post-baccalaureate work, and master’s program, I consistently found myself drawn to outreach. It became a source of inspiration, pushing me to become a better teacher, communicator, and researcher. Thanks to the support of student organizations like the Association of students of Biology at UPRM (AEB) and my peers in the Locke Lab, we had the opportunity to engage with K–12 students on multiple occasions!</div>

Some of the work we did was:

1. Parasitology demonstrations and co-presenter with Yanella Colon, for high school students at the ICA highschool, titled “Aquatic Biology and Parasitology Lab.” August 29, 2025. (20 students). 

 

1. Parasitology lab tour co-presenter where first year biology students from the UPRM came to the Locke Lab and with lab member Yanella Colon explained our research for “Prepa Week”, at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez campus, July 29, 2025. (100 students). 

 

1. Parasitology workshop “Let’s Be Biologists” for undergraduate students, organized with the assistance of master’s student volunteers (Alan and Alondra), for a group of 10 participants. Invasive mollusks and guppies were collected and evaluated for parasitological presence. Students were also exposed to live cercariae staining techniques and given an introduction to parasitology. Information about research opportunities, including the GRFP, UW REU, and PR-LSAMP, was also presented, at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez Campus, Biology Department building, on April 26, 2024. 

 

1. Parasitology lab tour for the Association of Students of Biology, where I, with the support of María Díaz-Gonzalez, explained our research to undergraduates on Earth Week, at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez campus, April 22, 2024 

 

1. Parasitology lab tour co-presenter where 90 K-12 students came to the Locke Lab and each member of the lab. gave a presentation on their research at the Sprouting-MIT event, at the University of Puerto Rico Mayagüez campus Biology Department building, November 11, 2024 

 

1. Informative table presenting the laboratory of parasitology research with lab peers of Dr. Locke’s lab, at the Biology Research Symposium for undergraduate students, at University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez campus, May 3, 2024 

 

1. Panelist for the Professionals in ecology and microbiology panel for the Association of Students in Biology, at Student's center room “Tarzan”, at University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez campus, March 19, 2024 


1. As a master’s student in biology at UPRM, I participated in a presentation and demonstrations for K-12 students on What is ecology? at Eugenio María De Hostos Special Vocational Center as a member of the Association of Students in Biology UPRM by explaining what the master’s student experience in Biology, November 17, 2023  

 
2. During my presidency of the AEB, I created a project to promote outreach activities at school called SCHOOL OUTREACH AEB-UPRM where we provided informative tables with electronic microscopes and dissection microscopes, provided the support of our advisor Dr. Van Ee. The tables were for K-12 students. Visits: Carib Christian School, Ramón Olivares School, Monserrate León de Irizarry School, Alcides Figueroa School, and San Agustín School, May 3, 2023, April 20, 2023, March 30, 2023, March 9, 2023, and January 30, 2023 
 

3. Camp of Agro-enviromental development in a collaboration between the Association of Student of Biology (AEB), Colegiales against contamination, Association of Natural Resources and Green Campus. Worked as part of the committee who organized the Camp, as well as a co-leader with PhD candidate Mellisa Ortiz on the “Water quality and freshwater parasites in Puerto Rico” fieldtrip, February 3-5, 2023
