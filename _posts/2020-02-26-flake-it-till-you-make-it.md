As my first blog post, I want to dedicate this post to my roommates, who have made the transition to Seattle an unexpectedly enjoyable one. 

 

Moving was always going to be a challenge, but having supportive, funny, and thoughtful people around has made all the difference. I’ve come to appreciate the value of living with peers who share the goal of growing both as professionals and as people. Each of them brings their own story, and by sharing, we all get to learn something new. 

 

Being part of a group that takes time to connect, especially before the quarter gets more intense, has been grounding. These small moments of connection not only enrich my life but also lay the foundation for future friendships. 

 

I look forward to continuing this journey with new friends and colleagues. 

 

I’ve also already explored local grocery options-Safeway, QFC, and the UW Food Pantry have been incredibly helpful. I’ve visited the arboretum twice (once in January and again with my cohort), grabbed coffee at Saint Bread and Agua Verde, and I’ve gotten comfortable using the light rail and the bus. 

 

As for how this move connects with my academic work, relocating allowed me to join the Wood Lab, a group of researchers who stand out for their talent and collaboration. Like any degree, this path will take hard work and growth. Through it, I will develop new skills in coding, ecological statistics, and the study of museum-preserved fish and parasites. 

I’m grateful to be part of this lab, a place shaped by curious and dedicated minds.
